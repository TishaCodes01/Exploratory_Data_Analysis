# Driver Location & Delivery EDA 
Welcome to the **Driver Location and Delivery EDA project** repository! üöÄ

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of driver movements, delivery timings, and container logistics using Python.

The project analyzes real-world logistics data to understand driver activity patterns, optimize delivery routes, and visualize high-density areas with interactive heatmaps.

# üìÅ Dataset 
The dataset used in this project captures driver activities and logistics movement data over time.

Dataset Overview:


| Column Name              | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Driver**                | Name of the driver (e.g., Joe) |
| **Time**                  | Timestamp when the location was recorded |
| **Location**              | Latitude and Longitude coordinates of the driver's position |
| **Load Reference Number** | Unique identifier for the load or delivery associated with the driver |

# üß© Problem Statement
Efficient management of drivers and deliveries is crucial for logistics companies to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

This project aims to solve the following key problems:

üëâ Identify driver movement patterns over time and geography.

üëâVisualize high-density zones where driver activities are concentrated.

üëâAnalyze delivery behavior based on time, location, and load information.

üëâProvide actionable insights to optimize route planning, delivery timing, and resource allocation.

By performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the driver's location and delivery data, the project helps uncover hidden trends and patterns that can significantly enhance logistics decision-making.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand driver activities, carrier information, and delivery movement patterns.  
The main EDA steps included:

- **Data Loading**  
  Loaded the driver location history dataset using `pandas`.

- **Initial Data Inspection**  
  - Checked dataset structure with `.info()` and `.head(20)`.
  - Identified columns like `Driver`, `Carrier`, `Time`, `Location`, and `Load Reference Number`.

- **Data Cleaning**  
  - Converted the `Time` column from object type to `datetime` format using `pd.to_datetime()`.
  - Handled invalid date formats and missing values by coercing errors during conversion.
  - Verified the success of conversion and checked for null entries in the `Time` field.

- **Data Exploration**  
  - Analyzed the unique values in `Carrier` to understand the distribution of drivers across different logistics companies.
  - Reviewed driver activities by inspecting early entries from the dataset.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Extracted `latitude` and `longitude` from the `Location` field (optional if implemented later).
  - Planned time-based aggregations for trend analysis.

- **Visualization Preparation**  
  - Prepared the data for **Heatmap visualization** to show areas with a high concentration of driver activity based on latitude and longitude.

## üìà Visualizations

The visualizations focused on understanding driver activity patterns and geospatial movement.

Key visualization:

- **Driver Location Heatmap**  
  - An interactive heatmap was created using `folium` and `folium.plugins.HeatMap` to visualize the geographic distribution of driver activities.  
  - The heatmap plots latitude and longitude coordinates, highlighting areas with high driver density (hotspots) on a real-world map.  
  - This visualization helps identify popular delivery zones, peak driver locations, and opportunities for route optimization.

# üìä Key Insights

- **Nick handles the highest number of loads and works the most average hours** compared to Joe and Morris.
- **Morris consistently handles the least amount of load** and has relatively fewer working hours.
- **Joe and Morris have similar working hours**, but both are lower than Nick‚Äôs working hours.
- **Peak delivery activity occurs between 12 PM and 6 PM**, indicating afternoons are the busiest delivery period.
- **Early mornings (6 AM - 12 PM) have the lowest delivery activity**, suggesting limited deliveries during that period.
- **Daily delivery counts fluctuate significantly**, reflecting operational variability across different days.
- **Nick transfers the maximum load daily**, whereas **Morris handles the minimum daily load**.
- **Driver working hours vary sharply per day**, indicating dynamic workloads based on demand.
- **Houston is the most frequently visited city** for all drivers, making it the primary delivery hub.
- **Joe‚Äôs most visited locations** are **Houston**, **Nuevo Laredo**, and **Austin**.
- **Nick‚Äôs most visited locations** are **Houston**, **Baton Rouge**, **Austin**, and **Arkansas**.
- **Morris‚Äôs most visited locations** are **Houston**, **Corpus Christi**, and **Dallas**.
- **Most of the total load is concentrated in Houston, Austin, Corpus Christi, and Dallas**, based on geospatial analysis.

# üìù Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of driver location and delivery data in a logistics environment.

- By systematically cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data, we uncovered valuable operational insights, including:

  - Identification of peak delivery periods and driver work patterns.

  - Analysis of load handling distributions among drivers.

  - Mapping of the most active delivery hubs such as Houston, Austin, Corpus Christi, and Dallas.

  - Driver-specific movement trends, highlighting individual contributions to overall operations.

The project highlights the importance of location intelligence and temporal analysis in optimizing logistics workflows.
The geospatial visualizations and time-based insights not only reveal current operational efficiencies but also point toward opportunities for strategic improvements in delivery planning, driver scheduling, and route optimization.
